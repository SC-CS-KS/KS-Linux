\par Lynx can be used to access information on the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 WWW\plain \f1\fs18 , or to build information systems intended primarily for local access. For example, Lynx has been used to build several\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Campus Wide Information Systems\plain \f1\fs18 \~(\plain \f1\i\fs18 CWIS\plain \f1\fs18 ). In addition, Lynx can be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.

\par In addition, a summary description of all the Lynx keystroke commands and their key bindings is available by pressing the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 K\plain \f1\fs18 ' key (or the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 k\plain \f1\fs18 ' key if vi-like key movement is not on). [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par If you want to recall recent status-line messages, you can do so by entering the `g' command, followed by `LYNXMESSAGES:'.
\par {\*\bkmkstart Local}{\*\bkmkend Local}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Viewing local files with Lynx
\par \plain \f1\fs18 Lynx can be started by entering the Lynx command along with the name of a file to display. For example these commands could all be used to display an arbitrary ASCII text or HTML file:UNIXlynx filenamelynx /home/my-dir/filenamelynx ~/filenameVMSlynx filenamelynx dua5:[my-directory]filenamelynx /dua5/my-directory/filenamelynx ~/filenamelynx sys$login:filenamelynx /sys$login/filenameWin32/DOSlynx file:///filenamelynx filenamelynx c:/dir/filenamelynx //n/dir/filename
\par When executed, Lynx will clear the screen and display as much of the specified file as will fit on the screen. Pressing a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~will bring up the next screen, and pressing an\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~will bring up the previous screen. If no file is specified at startup, a default file will be displayed, depending on settings e.g., in\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 .
\par Lynx will display local files written in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 HyperText Markup Language\plain \f1\fs18 \~(\plain \f1\i\fs18 HTML\plain \f1\fs18 ), if the file's name ends with the characters\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .html\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .htm\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .shtml\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .htmlx\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .html3\plain \f1\fs18 , or\plain \f1\i\fs18 .ht3\plain \f1\fs18 . HTML is a file format that allows users to create a file that contains (among other things) hypertext links to other files. Several files linked together may be described as a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 hypertext document\plain \f1\fs18 . If the filename does not have one of the suffixes mapped by Lynx to HTML, the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -force_html\plain \f1\fs18 \~command line option can be included to force treatment of the file as hypertext.
\par When Lynx displays an HTML file, it shows links as "bold face" text, except for one link, which is shown as "highlighted" text. Whether "boldface" or "highlighted" text shows up as reverse video, boldface type, or a color change, etc. depends on the display device being used (and the way in which that device has been configured). Lynx has no control over the exact presentation of links.
\par The one link displayed as "highlighted" text is the currently "selected" link. Lynx will display the file associated with the selected link when a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or a\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~key is pressed. To select a particular link, press the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys until the desired link becomes "highlighted," and then press the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~key to view the linked information. Information included in the HTML file tells Lynx where to find the linked file and what kind of server will provide it (i.e., HTTP, Gopher, etc.).
\par Lynx renders HTML files and saves the rendition (and the source, if so configured in the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~file) for initial display and should you select the link again. If you do select a link again and have reason to desire a new fetch and rendering of the file, use the NOCACHE command, normally mapped to '\plain \f1\i\fs18 x\plain \f1\fs18 ' and '\plain \f1\i\fs18 X\plain \f1\fs18 ', instead of the\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~key when positioned on the link. You also can force a new fetch and rendering of the currently displayed document via the RELOAD command, normally mapped to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Control-R\plain \f1\fs18 .
\par When a binary file is encountered Lynx will ask the user if he/she wishes to download the file or cancel. If the user selects '\plain \f1\i\fs18 D'\plain \f1\fs18 \~for download, Lynx will transfer the file into a temporary location and present the user with a list of options. The only default option is\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Save to disk\plain \f1\fs18 , which is disabled if Lynx is running in anonymous mode. Additional download methods may be defined in the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~file. Programs like kermit, zmodem and FTP are some possible options. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart Leaving}{\*\bkmkend Leaving}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Leaving Lynx
\par \plain \f1\fs18 To exit Lynx use the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 q\plain \f1\fs18 ' command. You will be asked whether you really want to quit. Answering '\plain \f1\i\fs18 y\plain \f1\fs18 ' will exit and '\plain \f1\i\fs18 n\plain \f1\fs18 ' will return you to the current document. Use '\plain \f1\i\fs18 Q\plain \f1\fs18 ' or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Control-D\plain \f1\fs18 \~to quit without verification. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart Remote}{\*\bkmkend Remote}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Starting Lynx with a Remote File
\par \plain \f1\fs18 If you wish to view a remote file (that is, a file residing on some computer system other than the one upon which you are running Lynx) without first viewing a local file, you must identify that file by using a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). URLs take the general form:
\par PROTOCOL :// HOST / PATH
\par where
\par PROTOCOLidentifies the communications protocol (\plain \f1\i\fs18 scheme\plain \f1\fs18 ) used by the server that will provide the file. As mentioned earlier, Lynx (and any WWW client) can interact with a variety of servers, each with its own protocol.HOSTis the Internet address of the computer system on which the server is running, andPATHis a scheme-specific field which for some schemes may correspond to a directory path and/or filename.Here are some sample URLs.HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)http://www.subir.com/lynx.htmlGophergopher://gopher.micro.umn.edu/11/FTP (File Transfer Protocol)ftp://ftp2.cc.ukans.edu/pub/lynx/READMEWAIS (Wide Area Information Service protocol)wais://cnidr.org/directory-of-serversA URL may be specified to Lynx on the command line, as in:lynx http://kufacts.cc.ukans.edu/cwis/kufacts_start.htmlLynx also will attempt to create a complete URL if you include adequate portions of it in the startfile argument.

\par \plain \f1\fs18 The process of moving within a hypertext web, selecting and displaying links is known as "navigation." With Lynx almost all navigation can be accomplished with the arrow keys and the numeric keypad.                                       +-------+-------+-------+\'0a

\par There are also a few other keyboard commands to aid in navigation. The Control and Function keys used for navigation within the current document are described in\plain \f1\i\ul\fs18\cf1 Scrolling and Other useful commands\plain \f1\fs18 . Some additional commands depend on the fact that Lynx keeps a list of each link you visited to reach the current document, called the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 History Page\plain \f1\fs18 , and a list of all links visited during the current Lynx session, called the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Visited Links Page\plain \f1\fs18 . The HISTORY keystroke command, normally mapped to\plain \f1\i\fs18 Backspace\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Delete\plain \f1\fs18 , will show you the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 History Page\plain \f1\fs18 \~of links leading to your access of the current document. Any of the previous documents shown in the list may be revisited by selecting them from the history screen. The VLINKS keystroke command, normally mapped to uppercase '\plain \f1\i\fs18 V\plain \f1\fs18 ', will show the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Visited Links Page\plain \f1\fs18 , and you similarly can select links in that list. The MAIN_MENU keystroke command, normally mapped to '\plain \f1\i\fs18 m\plain \f1\fs18 ' and '\plain \f1\i\fs18 M\plain \f1\fs18 ', will take you back to the starting document unless you specified the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -homepage=URL\plain \f1\fs18 \~option at the command line. Also, the LIST and ADDRLIST keystroke commands, normally mapped to '\plain \f1\i\fs18 l\plain \f1\fs18 ' and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 ' respectively, will create a compact lists of all the links in the current document, and they can be selected via those lists.
\par The '\plain \f1\i\fs18 i\plain \f1\fs18 ' key presents an index of documents. The default index offered contains many useful links, but can be changed in\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~or on the command line using the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -index=URL\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch.
\par If you choose a link to a server with active access authorization, Lynx will automatically prompt for a username and a password. If you give the correct information, you will then be served the requested information. Lynx will automatically send your username and password to the same server if it is needed again.

\par {\*\bkmkstart Disposing}{\*\bkmkend Disposing}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Printing, Mailing, and Saving rendered files to disk.
\par \plain \f1\fs18 Rendered HTML documents, and plain text files, may be printed using the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 p\plain \f1\fs18 ' command while viewing the document. After pressing the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 p\plain \f1\fs18 ' key a menu of\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Print Options\plain \f1\fs18 will be displayed. The menu will vary according to several factors. First, some sites set up special accounts to let users run Lynx to access local information systems. Typically these accounts require no passwords and do not require users to identify themselves. As a result such accounts are called "anonymous" accounts, and their users are considered "anonymous" users. In most configurations, all Lynx users (including anonymous users) are able to mail files to themselves and print the entire file to the screen.
\par Additional print options are available for users who are using Lynx from their own accounts (that is, so-called "non-anonymous users"). In particular, the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Save to a local file\plain \f1\fs18 \~option allows you to save the document into a file on your disk space. Additional print options may also be available as configured in the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~file.
\par Some options, such as\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Save to a local file\plain \f1\fs18 , involve prompting for an output filename. All output filename entries are saved in a circular buffer, and any previous entries can be retrieved for re-use by pressing the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys at the prompt.
\par Note that if you want exact copies of text files without any expansions of TAB characters to spaces you should use the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Download\plain \f1\fs18 \~options. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart LocalSource}{\*\bkmkend LocalSource}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Viewing the HTML document source and editing documents
\par \plain \f1\fs18 When viewing HTML documents it is possible to retrieve and display the unrendered (i.e., the original HTML) source of the document by pressing the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 \\\plain \f1\fs18 ' (backslash) key. Lynx usually caches only the rendering of the document and doesn't keep the source (unless it is configured to do so in the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~file), so to display the source unrendered, Lynx must reload it from the server or disk. When viewing unrendered documents you may print them as any normal document.
\par Selecting the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Print to a local file\plain \f1\fs18 \~option from the Print Menu, makes it possible to save the source of the document to disk so that you may have a local copy of the document source, but it is better to\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Download\plain \f1\fs18 \~the source.
\par NOTE: When saving an HTML document it is important to name the document with a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .html\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .htm\plain \f1\fs18 \~extension, if you want to read it with Lynx again later.
\par Lynx can allow users to edit documents that reside on the local system. To enable editing, documents must be referenced using a "file:" URL or by specifying a plain filename on the command line as in the following two examples:
\par Commandlynx file://localhost/FULL/PATH/FILENAMElynx path/filename.htmlIn addition, the user must also specify an editor in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 \~so that Lynx knows which editor to use. If the file is specified correctly and an editor is defined, then you may edit documents by using the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 e\plain \f1\fs18 ' command. When the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 e\plain \f1\fs18 ' command is entered your specified editor is spawned to edit the file. After changes are completed, exit your editor and you will return to Lynx. Lynx will reload and render the file so that changes can be immediately examined. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart RemoteSource}{\*\bkmkend RemoteSource}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Downloading and Saving source files.
\par \plain \f1\fs18 If the DOWNLOAD keystroke command ('\plain \f1\i\fs18 d\plain \f1\fs18 ' or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 D\plain \f1\fs18 ) is used when positioned on a link for an HTML, plain text, or binary file, Lynx will transfer the file, without rendering, into a temporary location and present the user with a list of options, just as it does when a link for a binary file of a type for which no viewer has been mapped is activated.
\par There is a default\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Download option\plain \f1\fs18 \~of\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Save to disk\plain \f1\fs18 . This is disabled if Lynx is running in anonymous mode. Any number of download methods such as kermit and zmodem may be defined in addition to this default in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~file. Using the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Save to disk\plain \f1\fs18 \~option under the PRINT command after viewing the source of an HTML with the VIEW SOURCE (\plain \f1\i\fs18 \\\plain \f1\fs18 ) command will result in a file which differs from the original source in various ways such as tab characters expanded to spaces. Lynx formats the source presentation in this mode. On the other hand, if the DOWNLOAD command is used, the only change will be that Lynx optionally puts
\par \pard\li720\fi-360\jclisttab\tx720\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\listtext\pard\plain\f4\fs24 \tab}\ls2\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 <!--X-URL: http://www.site.foo/path/to/file.html -->

\par \plain\pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f1\fs18 at the start of the file so that relative URLs in the document will still work. Even this modification can be prevented by setting PREPEND_BASE_TO_SOURCE:FALSE in lynx.cfg.
\par Some options, such as\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Save to disk\plain \f1\fs18 , involve prompting for an output filename. All output filename entries are saved in a circular buffer, and any previous entries can be retrieved for re-use by pressing the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys at the prompt.

\par {\*\bkmkstart ReDo}{\*\bkmkend ReDo}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Reloading files and refreshing the display
\par \plain \f1\fs18 The RELOAD (\plain \f1\i\fs18 Control-R\plain \f1\fs18 ) command will reload and re-render the file that you are currently viewing. The REFRESH (\plain \f1\i\fs18 Control-L\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Control-W\plain \f1\fs18 ) command will refresh or wipe the screen to remove or correct any errors that may be caused by operating system or other messages.
\par The NOCACHE ('\plain \f1\i\fs18 x\plain \f1\fs18 ' or '\plain \f1\i\fs18 X\plain \f1\fs18 ') command can be used in lieu of ACTIVATE (\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 ) to request an uncached copy and new rendition for the current link, or resubmission of a FORM, if a cache from a previous request or submission exits. The request or submission will include\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Pragma: no-cache\plain \f1\fs18 \~and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Cache-Control: no-cache\plain \f1\fs18 \~in its headers. Note that FORMs with POST content will be resubmitted regardless of whether the NOCACHE or ACTIVATE command is used (see\~\plain \f1\i\ul\fs18\cf1 Lynx and HTML Forms\plain \f1\fs18 ). [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart Search}{\*\bkmkend Search}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Lynx searching commands
\par \plain \f1\fs18 Two commands activate searching in Lynx: '\plain \f1\i\fs18 /\plain \f1\fs18 ' and '\plain \f1\i\fs18 s\plain \f1\fs18 '.
\par While viewing a normal document use the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 /\plain \f1\fs18 ' command to find a word or phrase within the current document. The search type will depend on the search option setting in the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 . The search options are case sensitive and case insensitive. These searches are entirely local to Lynx.
\par Some documents are designated\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 index documents\plain \f1\fs18 \~by virtue of an ISINDEX element in their HEAD section. These documents can be used to retrieve additional information based on searches using words or phrases submitted to an index server. The Lynx statusline will indicate that you are viewing such a document, and if so, the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 s\plain \f1\fs18 ' key will invoke a statusline prompt to enter a query string. The prompt can be specified via a PROMPT attribute in the ISINDEX element. Otherwise, Lynx will use an internally configured prompt. The address for submitting the search can be specified via an HREF or ACTION attribute. Otherwise, Lynx will use the current document's URL and append your query string as a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ?searchpart\plain \f1\fs18 \~(see\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Supported URLs\plain \f1\fs18 ).
\par All search words or strings which you have entered during a Lynx session are saved in a circular buffer, and can be retrieved for re-use by pressing the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys at the prompt for a search word or string. Also, you can use the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 n\plain \f1\fs18 'ext command to repeat a search with the last-entered search word or phrase, starting from the current position in the document. The word or phrase matches will be highlighted throughout the document, but such highlighting will not persist for new documents, or if the current document is reloaded. The search cycles to the top of the document if the word or phrase is not located below your current position.
\par Although\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML Forms\plain \f1\fs18 \~have largely replaced index documents for searches via http servers, they are still useful for performing searches directly via WAIS or Gopher servers in conjunction with the internal gateways for such servers. For example, an HTML index document can act as a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 cover page\plain \f1\fs18 \~describing a WAIS database and how to formulate query strings for searching it, and include an element such as:
\par \plain \f1\i\fs18 <ISINDEX PROMPT="Enter WAIS query:"\'0a 
\par                HREF="wais://net.bio.net/biologists-addresses">
\par \plain \f1\fs18 for submitting a search of the Biologist's Addresses database directly to the net.bio.net WAIS server. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]

\par An option can be changed by entering the capital letter or character in parentheses for the option you wish to change (e.g., '\plain \f1\i\fs18 E\plain \f1\fs18 ' for Editor or '\plain \f1\i\fs18 @\plain \f1\fs18 ' for show cursor). For fields where text must be entered, simply enter the text by typing on the keyboard. The\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Line Editor\plain \f1\fs18 \~can be used to correct mistakes, and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Control-U\plain \f1\fs18 \~can be used to erase the line. When you are done entering a change press the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~key to get back to the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Command?\plain \f1\fs18 \~prompt.
\par For fields where you must choose one of two choices, press any key to toggle the choices and press the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~key to finish the change.
\par For fields where you potentially have more than two choices, popup windows may be evoked which function homologously to those for select fields in\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML Forms\plain \f1\fs18 . The popup windows will be invoked only if you have popups for select fields set to ON (see below). Otherwise, your cursor will be positioned at the current choice, and you can press any key to cycle through the choices, then press the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~key to finish the change.
\par When you are done changing options use the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 r\plain \f1\fs18 ' command to return to Lynx or the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 >\plain \f1\fs18 ' command to save the options to a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .lynxrc\plain \f1\fs18 \~file and return to Lynx.
\par The following table describes the options available on the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 :
\par Assumed document character setThis option changes the handling of documents which do not explicitly specify a charset. Normally Lynx assumes that 8-bit characters in those documents are encoded according to iso-8859-1 (the official default for the HTTP protocol). Unfortunately, many non-English web pages "forget" to include proper charset info; this option helps you to browse those broken pages if you know by some means what the charset is. When the value given here or by an -assume_charset command line flag is in effect, Lynx will treat documents as if they were encoded accordingly. This option active when 'Raw 8-bit or CJK Mode' is OFF.Auto SessionLynx can save and restore useful information about your browsing history. Use this setting to enable or disable the feature.Bad HTML messagesSuppress or redirect Lynx's messages about "Bad HTML":Ignoredo not warn; no details are written to the trace-file.Add to trace-fileadd the detailed warning message to the trace-file.Add to LYNXMESSAGESadd the detailed warning message to the message page at "LYNXMESSAGES:".Warn, point to trace-fileshow a warning message on the status line; the complete message is written to the trace-file.Bookmark fileWhen multi-bookmarks is OFF, this is the filename and location of your default personal bookmark file. Enter '\plain \f1\i\fs18 B\plain \f1\fs18 ' to modify the filename and/or location via the\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Line Editor\plain \f1\fs18 . Bookmark files allow frequently traveled links to be stored in personal easy to access files.
\par Using the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 a\plain \f1\fs18 'dd bookmark link command (see\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Lynx bookmarks\plain \f1\fs18 ) you may save any link that does not have associated POST content into a bookmark file. All bookmark files must be in or under your account's home directory. If the location specified does not begin with a dot-slash (./), its presence will still be assumed, and referenced to the home directory.
\par When multi-bookmarks is STANDARD or ADVANCED, entering '\plain \f1\i\fs18 B\plain \f1\fs18 ' will invoke a menu of up to 26 bookmark files (associated with the letters of the English alphabet), for editing their filenames and locations (\plain \f1\i\fs18 filepath\plain \f1\fs18 ), and descriptions.
\par Lynx will create bookmark files, if they don't already exist, when you first '\plain \f1\i\fs18 a\plain \f1\fs18 'dd a bookmark link to them. However, if you've specified a subdirectory (e.g., ./BM/lynx_bookmarks.html), that subdirectory must already exist. Note that on VMS you should use the URL syntax for the filepath (e.g.,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 not\plain \f1\fs18 [.BM]lynx_bookmarks.html).
\par CookiesThis option allows you to tell how to handle cookies:\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ignore\plain \f1\fs18 , prompt (\plain \f1\i\fs18 ask user\plain \f1\fs18 ) or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 accept all\plain \f1\fs18 .Display Character setThis option allows you to set up the default character set for your specific terminal. The display character set provides a mapping from the character encodings of viewed documents and from HTML entities into viewable characters. It should be set according to your terminal's character set so that characters other than 7-bit ASCII can be displayed correctly, using approximations if necessary. You must have the selected character set installed on your terminal. (Since Lynx now supports a wide range of platforms it may be useful to note that cpXXX codepages used within IBM PC computers, and windows-xxxx within native MS-Windows apps.)EditorThe editor to be invoked when editing browsable files, when sending mail or comments, when preparing a news article for posting, and for external TEXTAREA editing. The full pathname of the editor command should be specified when possible.Emacs keysIf set to ON then the CTRL-P, CTRL-N, CTRL-F, and CTRL-B keys will be mapped to up-arrow, down-arrow, right-arrow, and left-arrow, respectively. Otherwise, they remain mapped to their configured bindings (normally UP_TWO lines, DOWN_TWO lines, NEXT_PAGE, and PREV_PAGE, respectively).
\par Note: this has no direct effect on the line-editor's key bindings.
\par Execution links
\par This deals with execution of local scripts or links:Local execution is activated when Lynx is first set up. If it has not been activated you will not see this option in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 .When a local execution script is encountered Lynx checks the users options to see whether the script can be executed. Users have the following options:Always offLocal execution scripts will never be executedFor Local files onlyLocal execution scripts will only be executed if the script to be executed resides on the local machine, and is referenced by a URL that begins with\plain \f1\i\fs18 file://localhost\plain \f1\fs18 Always onAll local execution scripts will be executedIf the users options permit the script to be executed Lynx will spawn a shell and run the script. If the script cannot be executed Lynx will show the script within the Lynx window and inform the user that the script is not allowed to be executed and will ask the user to check his/her options. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]FTP sort criteriaThis option allows you to specify how files will be sorted within FTP listings. The current options include "By Filename", "By Size", "By Type", and "By Date".HTML error recoverySelect the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 recovery mode\plain \f1\fs18 \~used by Lynx.Invalid-Cookie PromptingThis allows you to tell how to handle invalid cookies:\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 prompt normally\plain \f1\fs18 \~to prompt for each cookie,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 force yes-response\plain \f1\fs18 \~to reply "yes" to each prompt,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 force no-response\plain \f1\fs18 \~to reply "no" to each prompt.Keypad modeThis option gives the choice among navigating with the arrow keys, or having every link numbered so that the links may be selected or made current by numbers as well as using the arrow keys, or having every link as well as every form field numbered so that they can be selected or sought by numbers. See the
\par \~\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Follow link (or page) number:\plain \f1\fs18 \~and
\par \~\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Select option (or page) number:
\par \plain \f1\fs18 help for more information.Line edit styleThis option allows you to set alternative key bindings for the built-in line editor, if alternative line-edit bindings have been compiled in. Otherwise, Lynx uses the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Default Binding\plain \f1\fs18 .Local directory sort criteriaThis applies to directory editing. Files and directories can be presented in the following ways:Mixed styleFiles and directories are listed together in alphabetical order.Directories firstFiles and directories are separated into two alphabetical lists. Directories are listed first.Files firstFiles and directories are separated into two alphabetical lists. Files are listed first.Local directory sort orderThe Options Form also allows you to sort by the file attributes.By nameby filename (the default)By sizeby file size, in descending orderBy dateby file modification time, in descending orderBy modeby file protectionBy typeby filename suffix, e.g., the text beginning with '.'By userby file owner's user-idBy groupby file owner's group-idMulti-bookmarksLynx supports a default bookmark file, and up to 26 total bookmark files (see below). When multi-bookmarks is OFF, the default bookmark file is used for the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 v\plain \f1\fs18 'iew bookmarks and '\plain \f1\i\fs18 a\plain \f1\fs18 'dd bookmark link commands. If multi-bookmark support is available in your account, the setting can be changed to STANDARD or ADVANCED. In STANDARD mode, a menu of available bookmarks always is invoked when you seek to view a bookmark file or add a link, and you select the bookmark file by its letter token (see\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Bookmark file\plain \f1\fs18 , below) in that menu. In ADVANCED mode, you instead are prompted for the letter of the desired bookmark file, but can enter '\plain \f1\i\fs18 =\plain \f1\fs18 ' to invoke the STANDARD selection menu, or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 RETURN\plain \f1\fs18 \~for the default bookmark file.Password for anonymous ftpIf this is blank, Lynx will use your personal mail address as the anonymous ftp password. Though that is the convention, some users prefer to use some other string which provides less information. If the given value lacks a "@", Lynx also will use your computer's hostname as part of the password. If both this field and the personal mail address are blank, Lynx will use your $USER environment variable, or "WWWuser" if even the environment variable is unset.Pause when showing messageIf set to "off", this overrides the INFOSECS setting in lynx.cfg, to eliminate pauses when displaying informational messages, like the "-nopause" command line option.Personal mail addressThis mail address will be used to help you send files to yourself and will be included as the From: address in any mail or comments that you send. It will also be sent as the From: field in HTTP or HTTPS requests if inclusion of that header has been enabled via the NO_FROM_HEADER definition in\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~(the compilation default is not to send the header), or via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -from\plain \f1\fs18 \~command line toggle.Popups for select fieldsLynx normally uses a popup window for the OPTIONs in form SELECT fields when the field does not have the MULTIPLE attribute specified, and thus only one OPTION can be selected. The use of popup windows can be disabled by changing this setting to OFF, in which case the OPTIONs will be rendered as a list of radio buttons. Note that if the SELECT field does have the MULTIPLE attribute specified, the OPTIONs always are rendered as a list of checkboxes.Preferred document languageThe language you prefer if multi-language files are available from servers. Use RFC 1766 abbreviations, e.g., en for English, fr for French, etc. Can be a comma-separated list, which may be interpreted by servers as descending order of preferences. You can also make your order of preference explicit by using q factors as defined by the HTTP protocol, for servers which understand it, for example: da,\~en-gb;q=0.8,\~en;q=0.7Preferred document charsetThe character set you prefer if sets in addition to ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII are available from servers. Use MIME notation (e.g., ISO-8859-2) and do not include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since those values are always assumed by default. Can be a comma-separated list, which may be interpreted by servers as descending order of preferences. You can also make your order of preference explicit by using q factors as defined by the HTTP protocol, for servers which understand it, for example: iso-8859-5,\~utf-8;q=0.8Preferred encodingWhen doing a GET, lynx tells what types of compressed data it can decompress (the "Accept-Encoding:" string). This is determined by compiled-in support for decompression or external decompression programs. Use this option to select none, one or all of the supported decompression types.Preferred media typeWhen doing a GET, lynx lists the MIME types which it knows how to present (the "Accept:" string). Depending on your system configuration, the mime.types or other data given by the GLOBAL_EXTENSION_MAP may include many entries that lynx really does not handle. Use this option to select one of the built-in subsets of the MIME types that lynx could list in the Accept.Accept lynx's internal typeslist only the types that are compiled into lynx.Also accept lynx.cfg's typeslists types defined in lynx.cfg, e.g., the VIEWER and Cern RULE or RULESFILE settings.Also accept user's typeslists types from the PERSONAL_EXTENSION_MAP setting in lynx.cfgAlso accept system's typeslists types from the GLOBAL_EXTENSION_MAP setting in lynx.cfgAccept all typesadds the types that are in lynx's built-in tables for external programs that may be used to present a document.Raw 8-bit or CJK ModeWhether 8-bit characters are assumed to correspond with the display character set and therefore are processed without translation via the chartrans conversion tables. Should be ON by default when the display character set is one of the Asian (CJK) sets and the 8-bit characters are Kanji multibytes. Should be OFF for the other display character sets, but can be turned ON when the document's charset is unknown (e.g., is not ISO-8859-1 and no charset parameter was specified in a reply header from an HTTP server to indicate what it is) but you know by some means that you have the matching display character set selected. Should be OFF when an Asian (CJK) set is selected but the document is ISO-8859-1 or another 'assumed document character set'. The setting also can be toggled via the RAW_TOGGLE command, normally mapped to '\plain \f1\i\fs18 @\plain \f1\fs18 ', and at startup via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -raw\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch.Send User-Agent header Controls whether the user-agent string will be sent.Session fileDefine the file name where lynx will store user sessions. This setting is used only when\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Auto Session\plain \f1\fs18 \~is enabled.Show colorThis option will be present if color support is available. If set to ON or ALWAYS, color mode will be forced on if possible. If (n)curses color support is available but cannot be used for the current terminal type, selecting ON is rejected with a message. If set to OFF or NEVER, color mode will be turned off.
\par ALWAYS and NEVER are not offered in anonymous accounts. If saved to a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .lynxrc\plain \f1\fs18 \~file in non-anonymous accounts, ALWAYS will cause Lynx to set color mode on at startup if supported. If Lynx is built with the slang library, this is equivalent to having included the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -color\plain \f1\fs18 \~command line switch or having the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 COLORTERM\plain \f1\fs18 environment variable set. If color support is provided by curses or ncurses, this is equivalent to the default behavior of using color when the terminal type supports it. If (n)curses color support is available but cannot be used for the current terminal type, the preference can still be saved but will have no effect.
\par A saved value of NEVER will cause Lynx to assume a monochrome terminal at startup. It is similar to the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -nocolor\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch, but (when the slang library is used) can be overridden with the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -color\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch.
\par If the setting is OFF or ON when the current options are saved to a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 .lynxrc\plain \f1\fs18 \~file, the default startup behavior is retained, such that color mode will be turned on at startup only if the terminal info indicates that you have a color-capable terminal, or (when the slang library is used) if forced on via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -color\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 COLORTERM\plain \f1\fs18 \~variable. This default behavior always is used in anonymous accounts, or if the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 option_save\plain \f1\fs18 \~restriction is set explicitly. If for any reason the startup color mode is incorrect for your terminal, set it appropriately on or off via this option.Show cursorLynx normally hides the cursor by positioning it to the right and if possible the very bottom of the screen, so that the current link or OPTION is indicated solely by its highlighting or color. If show cursor is set to ON, the cursor will be positioned at the left of the current link or OPTION. This is helpful when Lynx is being used with a speech or braille interface. It also is useful for sighted users when the terminal cannot distinguish the character attributes used to distinguish the current link or OPTION from the others in the screen display.Show dot filesIf display/creation of hidden (dot) files/directories is enabled, you can turn the feature on or off via this setting.Show imagesThis allows you to select the way in which Lynx shows image links. These are the available selections:

The searching type effects inter-document searches only, and determines whether searches for words within documents will be done in a case-sensitive or case-insensitive manner.Use locale-based character setThis option allows you to request lynx to obtain a MIME name from the operating system which corresponds to your locale setting. If successful, it overrides the normal setting of the display character set.Underline linksUse underline-attribute rather than bold for links.Use Passive FTPThis allows you to change whether Lynx uses passive ftp connections.User Agent headerThe header string which Lynx sends to HTTP servers to indicate the User-Agent is displayed here. Changes may be disallowed via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -restrictions\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch. Otherwise, the header can be changed temporarily to a string such as\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 L_y_n_x/2.8.7\plain \f1\fs18 \~for access to sites which discriminate against Lynx based on checks for the presence of "Lynx" in the header. If the User-Agent header has been changed, it can be restored to the built-in default value by deleting the modified string in the Options Menu. Whenever the User-Agent header is changed, the current document is reloaded, with the no-cache flags set, on exit from the Options Menu. Changes of the header are not saved in the RC file.\plain \f1\i\fs18 NOTE:\plain \f1\fs18 \~Some sites may regard misrepresenting the browser as fraudulent deception, or as gaining unauthorized access, if it is used to circumvent blocking that was intentionally put in place. Some browser manufacturers may find the transmission of their product's name objectionable. If you change the User-Agent string, it is your responsibility. The Options Menu issues a reminder whenever the header is changed to one which does not include "Lynx" or "L_y_n_x".User ModeThere are three possible choices: Novice, Intermediate, and Advanced.NoviceIn Novice mode two lines of help are displayed at the bottom of the screen.IntermediateIntermediate mode turns off the help lines.AdvancedAdvanced mode displays the URL of the currently selected link at the bottom of the screen.Verbose ImagesControls whether or not Lynx replaces the [LINK], [INLINE] and [IMAGE] comments (for images without ALT) with filenames of these images. This is extremely useful because now we can determine immediately what images are just decorations (button.gif, line.gif) and what images are important. This setting can also be toggled on startup via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -verbose\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch.VI keysIf set to ON then the lowercase h, j, k, and l keys will be mapped to left, down, up, and right arrow, respectively. The uppercase H, J, K, and L keys remain mapped to their configured bindings (normally HELP, JUMP, KEYMAP, and LIST, respectively).
\par Note: this has no effect on the line-editor's key bindings.
\par Visited PagesEnable several different views of the visited links:By First VisitBy First Visit ReversedAs Visit TreeBy Last VisitBy Last Visit ReversedX DisplayThis option is only relevant to X Window users. The DISPLAY (Unix) or DECW$DISPLAY (VMS) variable is picked up automatically from the environment if it has been previously set.
\par {\*\bkmkstart Mail}{\*\bkmkend Mail}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Comments and mailto: links
\par \plain \f1\fs18 At any time while viewing documents within Lynx, you may use the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 c\plain \f1\fs18 ' command to send a mail message to the owner of the current document if the author of the document has specified ownership. (Note to authors: if you want to assign the ownership to your document, you need to add into HEAD section a LINK element with appropriate value for REV attribute. Two values are recognized:\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 owner\plain \f1\fs18 \~and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 made\plain \f1\fs18 \~(these are case insensitive). For example,<HEAD>\'0a 
\par     \uc2\u8230 \'a1\'ad\'0a \uc1
\par     <LINK REV="made" HREF="mailto:user@somedomain.com">\'0a 
\par     \uc2\u8230 \'a1\'ad\'0a<\uc1
\par </HEAD>\'0a
\par You may also add a TITLE attribute with, for example, the name of your page) If no ownership is specified then comments are disabled. Certain links called\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 mailto:\plain \f1\fs18 links will also allow you to send mail to other people. Using the mail features within Lynx is straightforward.
\par Once you have decided to send a comment or have selected a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 mailto:\plain \f1\fs18 \~link a new screen will appear showing you to whom you are sending the message. Lynx will ask for your name, your e-mail address, and the subject of the message. If you have filled in the "personal mail address" field in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 , your e-mail address will be filled in automatically. After entering the above information, if you have an editor defined in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 \~and you are not an anonymous user then your specified editor will be spawned for you so that you can enter your message. If you do not have an editor defined or you are an anonymous user, a simple line mode input scheme will allow you to enter your message.
\par To finish sending the message, exit your spawned editor or, if you are using the simple line mode input scheme, type a '\plain \f1\i\fs18 .\plain \f1\fs18 ' (period) on a line by itself. You will be asked a final time whether to send the message. If you press '\plain \f1\i\fs18 y\plain \f1\fs18 ', you will be prompted whether to append your signature file if one was defined in\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~and is accessible, and then the message will be sent, whereas if you press '\plain \f1\i\fs18 n\plain \f1\fs18 ' the message will be deleted.

\par \pard\li720\fi-360\jclisttab\tx720\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\listtext\pard\plain\f4\fs24 \tab}\ls5\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 Save D)ocument or L)ink to bookmark file or C)ancel? (d,l,c):
\par \plain\pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f1\fs18 Answer '\plain \f1\i\fs18 d\plain \f1\fs18 ' to save a link to the document you are currently viewing or '\plain \f1\i\fs18 l\plain \f1\fs18 ' to save the link that is currently selected on the page. Selecting '\plain \f1\i\fs18 c\plain \f1\fs18 ' will cancel without saving anything to your bookmark file.
\par A bookmark file will be created in conjunction with acting on the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 a\plain \f1\fs18 'dd command if it does not already exist. Otherwise, the link will be added to the bottom of the pre-existing bookmark file. You must have created a bookmark file via the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 a\plain \f1\fs18 'dd command before you can view it.
\par Use the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 v\plain \f1\fs18 ' command to view the list of bookmarks you have saved. While viewing the bookmark list you may select a bookmark as you would any other link.
\par You can remove a link from the bookmark list by pressing the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 r\plain \f1\fs18 ' key when positioned on that link. You also can use a standard text editor (e.g., via the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 e\plain \f1\fs18 'dit command while viewing a bookmark file, if an external editor has been defined via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Options menu\plain \f1\fs18 ) to delete or re-order links in the bookmark file, or to modify a link name by editing the content of the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 nchor element for the link, but you should not change the format within the line for the link, consisting of an\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 LI\plain \f1\fs18 \~element followed by the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 nchor element, nor cause the line to become wrapped to a second line. You similarly can change the link destination by editing the double-quoted value for the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 HREF\plain \f1\fs18 \~attribute in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 nchor start tag, but you should not otherwise change the spacing within the start tag, nor add other attributes. You can add a new link while editing by copying an existing line for a link, to ensure the proper format, and then modifying its\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 HREF\plain \f1\fs18 \~value and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 nchor content, but you should not add any other HTML markup to the bookmark file. If the format and spacing (other than the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 nchor content or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 HREF\plain \f1\fs18 \~value) within lines is changed or other HTML markup is added, the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 a\plain \f1\fs18 'dd and '\plain \f1\i\fs18 r\plain \f1\fs18 'emove commands may not work properly.
\par When multi-bookmarks (see\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 ) is OFF, you will always view or add links to the default bookmark file. When it is STANDARD, a menu of up to 26 bookmark files will be invoked, and you select the bookmark file by entering its letter token. When it is ADVANCED, you will be prompted for the letter token, but can enter '\plain \f1\i\fs18 =\plain \f1\fs18 ' to invoke the STANDARD selection menu, or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 RETURN\plain \f1\fs18 \~for the default bookmark file. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart Jumps}{\*\bkmkend Jumps}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Jump Command
\par \plain \f1\fs18 Similar to the bookmarks file is the jumps file: for an example, look in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 samples\plain \f1\fs18 \~subdirectory in the distribution package. To use the jumps command, create a\plain \f1\i\fs18 jumps file\plain \f1\fs18 \~with the same format as the sample file, but containing your own URLs & short-cut names. Once you have done that, typing '\plain \f1\i\fs18 j\plain \f1\fs18 ' prompts you to enter a short-cut name, which will take you straight to the URL associated with the short-cut in the jumps file, much like using '\plain \f1\i\fs18 g\plain \f1\fs18 '. If you want to check which short-cuts are available, type '\plain \f1\i\fs18 ?\plain \f1\fs18 ' at the jump prompt for the full list.
\par All jump short-cuts you have entered are saved in a circular buffer in the same way as with '\plain \f1\i\fs18 g\plain \f1\fs18 ' and '\plain \f1\i\fs18 /\plain \f1\fs18 ' (search):
\par previous entries can be retrieved with\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 .
\par The jumps feature is especially useful for system administrators who have unsophisticated users to care for, but ordinary Lynx users who have a number of URLs they regularly visit while browsing may find using the jumps command speeds their movements.
\par For more advice how to set up the jumps command on your system and how to define short-cut names, read\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]

\par \plain \f1\fs18 Lynx offers extended DIRED support on Unix (on VMS the more powerful CSwing program is recommended for character cell terminals, and can be offered via Lynx as a jump shortcut or execution link). When a local directory is accessed using a URL of the form\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 file://localhost/path/\plain \f1\fs18 , a new set of commands is available. With DIRED support you can create, edit, delete, copy, and move files on your local system.

\par {\*\bkmkstart Forms}{\*\bkmkend Forms}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Lynx and HTML Forms
\par \plain \f1\fs18 This section describes the Lynx Forms Interface. HTML gives document providers the ability to create on-line forms which may be filled out when the document is viewed. When a form is submitted the information on the form can be used to search a database or complete a survey.
\par An HTML Form provides for the use of buttons to perform an action (such as\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 submit\plain \f1\fs18 ), checkboxes, radio buttons or popups to select options from a list, and fields for entering text.
\par Buttons:Buttons are displayed in the same way that Lynx displays links in a document. To "push" the button press the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~key. If it is a form submission button, you also can use the NOCACHE ('\plain \f1\i\fs18 x\plain \f1\fs18 ') or DOWNLOAD ('\plain \f1\i\fs18 d\plain \f1\fs18 ') keystroke commands to "push" the button (see below).Checkboxes and Radio buttonsCheckboxes are displayed as square brackets:\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 [ ]\plain \f1\fs18 \~and radio buttons are displayed as parenthesis:\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ( )\plain \f1\fs18 .

To select an option press the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~key. A box with a border of asterisks (or line-drawing characters) will pop up with the list of possible options listed within the box.

The default setting for use of popups or radio button lists can be toggled via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -popup\plain \f1\fs18 \~command line switch.Text Entry FieldsText entry (INPUT) fields are displayed as a row of underscores the length of the entry field:\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 _______\plain \f1\fs18 . You may enter text directly by typing at the keyboard. Use the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Line Editor\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys to correct errors. If you try to input more text than the field can hold, the line editor will not accept the additional characters. If you fill a text field the cursor will not move off the field but remain at the last field position. Use the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 , and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 TAB\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys to move up, or down from the text entry field.

\par {\*\bkmkstart CtrlVNote}{\*\bkmkend CtrlVNote}NOTE:\~If you have a text input field selected you will not have access to most of the Lynx keystroke commands, because they are interpreted by the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Line Editor\plain \f1\fs18 \~as either text entries or editing commands. Select a button or box when you want to use Lynx keystrokes; or prefix your keystroke with\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V\plain \f1\fs18 \~to temporarily escape from line editing.
\par Some flavors of UNIX, shells & terminal settings require that you enter\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V^Ve\plain \f1\fs18 \~in order to start the external editor, as they also use\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V\plain \f1\fs18 \~as default command-line quote key (called `lnext' in stty man pages and `stty -a' output); to avoid this, you can put `stty lnext undef' in your .cshrc file (or .profile or .bashrc, depending on what shell you use), or invoke Lynx with a wrapper script, e.g.
\par \~\~#!/bin/sh
\par \~\~stty lnext undef
\par \~\~$HOME/bin/lynx "$@"
\par \~\~stty lnext ^V
\par \~\~exit
\par NB when NOT in the Line Editor,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V\plain \f1\fs18 \~is by default bound to the command to switch between SortaSGML and TagSoup HTML parsing (i.e., SWITCH_DTD). To avoid confusion, either of these separate functions could be changed (mapped away) with a KEYMAP directive in\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 . For example,
\par \~\~KEYMAP:^V:DO_NOTHING
\par \~\~KEYMAP:#:SWITCH_DTD
\par would map SWITCH_DTD away from\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V\plain \f1\fs18 \~to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 #\plain \f1\fs18 , while leaving its default Line Editor function as a command escape in place. On the other hand,
\par \~\~KEYMAP:^V::NOP:1
\par \~\~KEYMAP:^_::LKCMD:1
\par would move\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V\plain \f1\fs18 's Line Editor binding as command escape to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^_\plain \f1\fs18 \~for the first Line Edit style, letting\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V\plain \f1\fs18 \~still act as SWITCH_DTD outside of text input fields.
\par TEXTAREA FieldsTEXTAREA fields are for most purposes handled as if they were a series of text entry (INPUT) fields for which successive lines imply a newline at the end of the preceding line. You enter text on each line to construct the overall message. Any blank lines at the bottom of the TEXTAREA field will be eliminated from the submission. The\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 , and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys move you to the preceding, or next line of the overall message, as for INPUT fields. The\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 TAB\plain \f1\fs18 \~key will move you down beyond the bottom of the TEXTAREA field, and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Back Tab\plain \f1\fs18 \~(if available, e.g., as Shift-Tab, and correctly mapped in the terminal description) will move backward to a link or field before the TEXTAREA.Editing TEXTAREA Fields and Special TEXTAREA FunctionsTEXTAREA fields can be edited using an external editor. The statusline should tell you when this is possible and what key to use, it might for example say\plain \f1\b\fs18           (Textarea) Enter text. \plain \f1\fs18 [ ..... ]\plain \f1\b\fs18  (^Xe for editor).\plain \f1\fs18 An external editor has to be defined, for example in the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 , before you can start using this function.
\par A key to invoke external TEXTAREA editing is normally provided by the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Line-Editor Key\plain \f1\fs18 \~Bindings. A KEYMAP directive in\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~can also be used to make a different key invoke external editing; it will then normally be necessary to prefix that key with\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V\plain \f1\fs18 \~to "escape" from line-editing. Two variants exist,
\par \~\~KEYMAP:e:EDITTEXTAREA
\par or
\par \~\~KEYMAP:e:DWIMEDIT
\par (the first is only functional for TEXTAREA editing, while the second allows to use the same key for normal\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 file editing\plain \f1\fs18 \~\plain \f1\i\fs18 as long as both functions don't conflict\plain \f1\fs18 ).
\par Please see the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 note above\plain \f1\fs18 \~for details about\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V\plain \f1\fs18 \~behavior.
\par You can also use two other special TEXTAREA functions. Again, these are already bound to key sequences in the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Line-Editor Bindings\plain \f1\fs18 , by default\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^Xg\plain \f1\fs18 \~and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^Xi\plain \f1\fs18 . You can use different keys by adding KEYMAP bindings to your\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~file, e.g.
\par \~\~KEYMAP:$:GROWTEXTAREA
\par \~\~KEYMAP:#:INSERTFILE
\par With these bindings, (in a TEXTAREA only)\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V$\plain \f1\fs18 \~would add 5 lines to the TEXTAREA and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^V#\plain \f1\fs18 \~would prompt for the name of an existing file to be inserted into the TEXTAREA (above the cursorline). An automatic variation of GROWTEXTAREA is normally compiled in, so that hitting\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Enter\plain \f1\fs18 \~with the cursor on the last line adds a new line to the TEXTAREA, with the cursor on it.
\par If you have some single keys (or control keys) to spare that you do not need for their normal purposes, you can dedicate those keys to invoke the special functions (without requiring a prefix key). For example, to use the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^E\plain \f1\fs18 \~key for the DWIMEDIT action, and the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Insert\plain \f1\fs18 \~key for the INSERTFILE action, use
\par \~\~KEYMAP:^E:DWIMEDIT:PASS
\par \~\~KEYMAP:0x10C:INSERTFILE:PASS
\par (see lynx.cfg for other keystroke codes to use).
\par Note that the default bindings that use\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^X\plain \f1\fs18 \~as a prefix key\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 may\plain \f1\fs18 \~also work by substituting the\~Escape\~key for ^X. If your keyboard has a modifier (Meta) key that gets transmitted as an ESC prefix, for example\~Alt, you can then even use\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Alt-e\plain \f1\fs18 \~instead of\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^Xe\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Alt-g\plain \f1\fs18 \~instead of\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ^Xg\plain \f1\fs18 , and so on. But this does not work reliably everywhere (it depends on the way Lynx is compiled, including which libraries are used, and behavior of the connection and terminal type).
\par In general, you can move around the form using the standard Lynx navigation keys. The\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys, respectively, select the previous or next field, box, or button. The\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 TAB\plain \f1\fs18 \~key selects the next field, box, or button.
\par To\~{\*\bkmkstart submit}{\*\bkmkend submit}\plain \f1\i\fs18 submit\plain \f1\fs18 \~the form press\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~when positioned on the form's submit button. If you've submitted the form previously during the Lynx session, have not changed any of the form content, and the METHOD was\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 GET\plain \f1\fs18 , Lynx will retrieve from its cache what was returned from the previous submission. If you wish to resubmit that form to the server with the same content as previously, use the NOCACHE command ('\plain \f1\i\fs18 x\plain \f1\fs18 ') when positioned on the submit button. The\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~keys also will invoke a no-cache resubmission if the reply from a form submission included a META element with a no-cache Pragma or Cache-Control directive:
\par \plain \f1\i\fs18 <META HTTP-EQUIV="Pragma" CONTENT="no-cache">
\par       <META HTTP-EQUIV="Cache-Control" CONTENT="no-cache">
\par \plain \f1\fs18 or the server sent a "Pragma" or "Cache-Control" MIME header with a no-cache directive.
\par You also can use the DOWNLOAD ('\plain \f1\i\fs18 d\plain \f1\fs18 ') keystroke command when positioned on a form submit button if you wish to download the server's reply to the submission instead of having Lynx render and display it.
\par Forms which have\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 POST\plain \f1\fs18 \~as the METHOD, or a\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 mailto:\plain \f1\fs18 \~URL as the ACTION, are always resubmitted, even if the content has not changed, when you activate the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 submit\plain \f1\fs18 \~button. Lynx normally will not resubmit a form which has\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 POST\plain \f1\fs18 \~as the METHOD if the document returned by the form has links which you activated, and then you go back via the PREV_DOC (\plain \f1\i\fs18 left-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 ) command or via the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 History Page\plain \f1\fs18 . Lynx can be compiled so that it resubmits the form in those cases as well, and the default can be changed via\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 , and toggled via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -resubmit_posts\plain \f1\fs18 \~command line switch.
\par If the form has one\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 text entry\plain \f1\fs18 \~field and no other fields except, possibly, hidden INPUT fields not included in the display, then that field also serves as a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 submit\plain \f1\fs18 button, and pressing\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 right-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Return\plain \f1\fs18 \~on that field will invoke submission of the form. Be sure to use\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 up-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 down-arrow\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 TAB\plain \f1\fs18 \~to move off the text entry field, in such cases, if it is not your intention to submit the form (or to retrieve what was returned from an earlier submission if the content was not changed and the METHOD was\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 GET\plain \f1\fs18 ).
\par Forms can have multiple\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 submit\plain \f1\fs18 \~buttons, if they have been assigned NAMEs in the markup. In such cases, information about which one of the buttons was used to submit the form is included in the form content.
\par Inlined images can be used as submit buttons in forms. If such buttons are assigned NAMEs in the markup, for graphic clients they can also serve as\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 image maps\plain \f1\fs18 , and the x,y coordinates of the graphic client's cursor position in the image when it was\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 clicked\plain \f1\fs18 \~are included in the form content. Since Lynx cannot inline the image, and the user could not have moved a cursor from the origin for the image, if no alternatives are made available in the markup Lynx sends a 0,0 coordinate pair in the form content. Document authors who use images as submit buttons, but have at least some concern for text clients and sight-challenged Webizens, should include VALUEs for the buttons in such markup. Lynx will then display the string assigned to the VALUE, as it would for a normal submit button. Some document authors incorrectly use an ALT instead of VALUE attribute for this purpose. Lynx "cooperates" by treating ALT as a synonym for VALUE when present in an INPUT tag with TYPE="image". If neither a VALUE nor an ALT attribute is present, Lynx displays "[IMAGE]-Submit" as the string for such buttons. If clickable images is set, the "[IMAGE]" portion of the string is a link for the image, and the "Submit" portion is the button for submitting the form. Otherwise, the entire string is treated as a submit button. If a VALUE or ALT attribute is present and clickable images is set, Lynx prepends "[IMAGE]" as a link for the image, followed by '-' and then the attribute's value as the displayed string for the submit button. Note that earlier versions of Lynx would send a name=value pair instead of a 0,0 coordinate pair if a TYPE="image" submit button was NAME-ed, had a VALUE attribute in the INPUT tag, and was used to submit the form. The script which analyzes the form content thus could be made aware whether the submission was by a user with a graphic client and had image loading turned on, or by a user who did not see the image nor make a conscious choice within it. However, requests that this be included in HTML specifications consistently have fallen on deaf ears, and thus Lynx now "fakes" a 0,0 coordinate pair whether or not a VALUE or ALT attribute is present in the INPUT tag. Ideally, the script which analyzes the submitted content will treat the 0,0 coordinate pair as an indicator that the user did not see the image and make a conscious choice within it.
\par Forms can have\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 hidden\plain \f1\fs18 \~INPUT fields, which are not displayed, but have NAMEs and VALUEs included in the content. These often are used to keep track of information across a series of related form submissions, but have the potential for including information about the user that might be considered to represent an invasion of privacy. NOTE, in this regard, that Lynx has implemented the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML 3.0\plain \f1\fs18 \~\plain \f1\i\fs18 DISABLED\plain \f1\fs18 \~attribute for\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 all\plain \f1\fs18 \~of its form fields. These can be used to keep track of information across submissions, and to cast it unmodifiable in the current form, but keep the user aware that it will be included in the submission.
\par Forms most commonly are submitted to http servers with the content encoded as\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ENCTYPE="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"\plain \f1\fs18 \~for analysis by a script, and Lynx treats that as the default if no ENCTYPE is specified in the FORM start tag. However, you can specify a\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 mailto\plain \f1\fs18 \~URL as the form's ACTION to have the form content sent, instead, to an email address. In such cases, you may wish to specify\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ENCTYPE="text/plain"\plain \f1\fs18 \~in the form markup, so that the content will not be encoded, but remain readable as plain text.
\par Lynx also supports\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ENCTYPE="application/sgml-form-urlencoded"\plain \f1\fs18 \~for which all reserved characters in the content will be hex escaped, as with\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 application/x-www-form-urlencoded\plain \f1\fs18 , but semicolons ('\plain \f1\i\fs18 ;\plain \f1\fs18 ') instead of ampersands ('\plain \f1\i\fs18 &\plain \f1\fs18 ') will be used as the separator for name=value pairs in the form content. The use of semicolons is preferred for forms with the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 GET\plain \f1\fs18 \~METHOD, because the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 GET\plain \f1\fs18 \~METHOD causes the encoded form content to be appended as a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ?searchpart\plain \f1\fs18 \~for the form's ACTION, and if such URLs are used in\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 text/html\plain \f1\fs18 \~documents or bookmark files without conversion of the ampersands to SGML character references (\plain \f1\i\fs18 &amp;\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 &#38;\plain \f1\fs18 ), their being followed by form field NAMEs which might correspond to SGML entities could lead to corruption of the intended URL.
\par NOTE, in this regard, that Lynx converts ampersands to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 &amp;\plain \f1\fs18 \~when creating bookmarks, and thus the bookmark links will not be vulnerable to such corruptions. Also NOTE that Lynx allows you to save links in your bookmark file for documents returned by forms with the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 GET\plain \f1\fs18 \~METHOD, and which thus have the content appended as a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ?searchpart\plain \f1\fs18 , but not if the METHOD was\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 POST\plain \f1\fs18 , because the content would be lost and the link thus would be invalid.
\par Lynx supports\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data"\plain \f1\fs18 \~for sending form content with name=value pairs encoded as multipart sections with individual MIME headers and boundaries. However, Lynx does not yet support INPUTs with\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 TYPE="file"\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 TYPE="range"\plain \f1\fs18 \~and will set the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 DISABLED\plain \f1\fs18 \~attribute for all of the form's fields if any INPUTs with either of those two TYPEs are present, so that the form can't be submitted. Otherwise, Lynx will submit the form with the multipart ENCTYPE.
\par A\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Content-Disposition:\~file;\~filename=name.suffix\plain \f1\fs18 \~header can be used by CGI scripts to set the suggested filename offered by Lynx for '\plain \f1\i\fs18 d\plain \f1\fs18 'ownload and '\plain \f1\i\fs18 p\plain \f1\fs18 'rint menu options to save or mail the body returned by the script following submission of a FORM. Otherwise, Lynx uses the last symbolic element in the path for the FORM's ACTION, which is normally the script, itself, or a PATH_INFO field, and thus might be misleading. This also can be done via a META element in any document:
\par \plain \f1\i\fs18 <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Disposition"\'0a 
\par             CONTENT="file;\~filename=name.suffix">

\par \plain \f1\fs18 HTML includes markup for creating\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 tables\plain \f1\fs18 \~structured as arrays of cells aligned by columns and rows on the displayed page.
\par Lynx recognizes the TABLE element and all of its associated elements as described in\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 RFC 1942\plain \f1\fs18 \~and will process any ID attributes in the start tags for handling as NAME-ed anchors, but does not create actual\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 tables\plain \f1\fs18 . Instead, it treats the TR start tag as a collapsible BR (line break), and inserts a collapsible space before the content of each TH and TD start tag. This generally makes all of the content of the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 table\plain \f1\fs18 \~readable, preserves most of the intra-cell organization, and makes all of the links in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 table\plain \f1\fs18 \~accessible, but any information critically dependent on the column and row alignments intended for the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 table\plain \f1\fs18 \~will be missed.
\par If inherently tabular data must be presented with Lynx, one can use PRE formatted content, or, if the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 table\plain \f1\fs18 \~includes markup not allowed for PRE content, construct the\plain \f1\i\fs18 table\plain \f1\fs18 \~using\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML Tabs\plain \f1\fs18 . An example\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 table\plain \f1\fs18 \~using\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 TAB\plain \f1\fs18 \~elements is included in the test subdirectory of the Lynx distribution.
\par Starting with version 2.8.3, Lynx renders some tables in tabular form. This tabular representation for\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 simple\plain \f1\fs18 \~tables (TRST) does not attempt to implement full support for any table model. Limitations are:
\par \pard\li720\fi-360\jclisttab\tx720\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\listtext\pard\plain\f3\fs24\lang1024 \uc2\u183 \'a1\'a4\uc1\tab}\ls6\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 All data constituting a table row generally has to fit within the display width without inserting line breaks.
\par \plain{\listtext\pard\plain\f3\fs24\lang1024 \uc2\u183 \'a1\'a4\uc1\tab}\ls6\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 Cell contents have to be simple. In general, only inline markup is acceptable, no\~<P>,\~<BR>\~etc. (although\~<BR>\~may be ignored at the beginning of the first cell or at the end of the last cell of a row).
\par \plain{\listtext\pard\plain\f3\fs24\lang1024 \uc2\u183 \'a1\'a4\uc1\tab}\ls6\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 When tables are nested, only the innermost level is a candidate for tabular representation.
\par \plain{\listtext\pard\plain\f3\fs24\lang1024 \uc2\u183 \'a1\'a4\uc1\tab}\ls6\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 Most attributes are ignored, including borders,\~WIDTH, vertical alignment.
\par \plain\pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f1\fs18 Horizontal alignments (LEFT,\~CENTER,\~RIGHT),\~COLSPAN, and\~ROWSPAN\~are interpreted according to HTML 4.01. (ROWSPAN\~can only reserve empty space in subsequent rows, because of the limitations above.) When TRST fails because a table is not "simple" enough, the representation falls back to the minimal handling described earlier. Many (but, unfortunately, by no means all) tables that represent inherently tabular material will thus be shown with correct tabular formatting. Where table markup is used only for layout purposes (containing whole blocks of text and list within table cells) and not essential for understanding the textual contents, it remains basically ignored. Some more information on details is available in the file\~README.TRST\~of the source distribution.
\par For tabular display of more complex tables, Lynx users can make use of external scripts or programs. The normal Lynx distribution currently does not provide such scripts, but they can be written locally or downloaded from several sources. It is suggested to use one of Lynx's facilities for invoking external programs (seeDOWNLOADER,\~PRINTER,\~EXTERNAL,\~TRUSTED_LYNXCGI\~in\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~and\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynxcgi:\plain \f1\fs18 \~in\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Supported URLs\plain \f1\fs18 \~for information on various ways for setting this up).

\par {\*\bkmkstart Tabs}{\*\bkmkend Tabs}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Lynx and HTML Tabs
\par \plain \f1\fs18 Lynx implements the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML 3.0\plain \f1\fs18 \~TAB element only when LEFT alignment is in effect. If the alignment is CENTER or RIGHT (JUSTIFY is not yet implemented in Lynx, and is treated as a synonym for LEFT), or if the TAB element indicates a position to the left of the current position on the screen, it is treated as a collapsible space. For purposes of implementing TAB, Lynx treats\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 en\plain \f1\fs18 \~units as half a character cell width when specified by the INDENT attribute, and rounds up for odd values (e.g., a value of either 5 or 6 will be treated as three spaces, each the width of a character cell). See the example\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 table\plain \f1\fs18 \~using TAB elements in the test subdirectory of the Lynx distribution as a model for using this functionality.

\par Lynx recognizes the Netscape and Microsoft Explorer FRAME, FRAMESET, and NOFRAMES elements, but is not capable of windowing to create the intended positioning of\plain \f1\i\fs18 frames\plain \f1\fs18 . Instead, Lynx creates labeled links to the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 frame\plain \f1\fs18 \~sources, typically positioned in the upper left corner of the display, and renders the NOFRAMES section. If the document provider has disregard for text clients and sight-challenged Webizens, and thus does not include substantive content in the NOFRAMES section or a link in it to a document suitable for text clients, you can usually guess from the labeling of the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 frame\plain \f1\fs18 \~links which one has the substantive material (if there is any), or you can try each of those links to see if anything worthwhile is returned.

The lists can be nested, yielding progressively greater indentation, up to six levels. The\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML 2.0\plain \f1\fs18 MENU and DIR elements\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 both\plain \f1\fs18 \~are treated as synonyms for UL with the PLAIN attribute (no\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 bullets\plain \f1\fs18 , see below). Note, thus, that neither DIR nor MENU yields a series of columns with 24-character spacing. A single nesting index is maintained, so that different types of List elements can be used for different levels within the nest. Also, the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML 3.0\plain \f1\fs18 \~FIG, CAPTION and CREDIT elements are treated as valid within list blocks. They will be rendered with indentation appropriate for the current nesting depth, and the CAPTION or CREDIT elements will have a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 CAPTION:\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 CREDIT:\plain \f1\fs18 \~label beginning the first line of their content. The content of any APPLET or OBJECT elements in the lists also will be indented appropriately for the current nesting depth, but those will not invoke line breaks unless indicated by their content, and it should not include markup which is inappropriate within the list.
\par Lynx also supports the TYPE attribute for OL elements, which can have values of\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 1\plain \f1\fs18 \~for Arabic numbers,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 I\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 i\plain \f1\fs18 \~for uppercase or lowercase Roman numerals, or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 a\plain \f1\fs18 \~for uppercase or lowercase letters, that increment for successive LI elements in the list block. The CONTINUE attribute can be used to continue the ordering from the preceding list block when the nesting depth is changed.
\par Lynx treats the OL attributes START and SEQNUM as synonyms for specifying the ordering value for the first LI element in the block. The values should be specified as Arabic numbers, but will be displayed as Arabic, Roman, or alphabetical depending on the TYPE for the block. The values can range from\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -29997\plain \f1\fs18 \~to the system's maximum positive integer for Arabic numbers. For Roman numerals, they can range from\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 1\plain \f1\fs18 \~(\plain \f1\i\fs18 I\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 i\plain \f1\fs18 ) to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 3000\plain \f1\fs18 \~(\plain \f1\i\fs18 MMM\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 mmm.\plain \f1\fs18 ). For alphabetical orders, the values can range from\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 1\plain \f1\fs18 \~(\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 a\plain \f1\fs18 ) to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 18278\plain \f1\fs18 \~(\plain \f1\i\fs18 ZZZ\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 zzz\plain \f1\fs18 ). If the CONTINUE attribute is used, you do not need to specify a START or SEQNUM attribute to extend the ordering from a previous block, and you can include a TYPE attribute to change among Arabic, Roman, or alphabetical ordering styles, or their casing, without disrupting the sequence. If you do not include a START, SEQNUM or CONTINUE attribute, the first LI element of each OL block will default to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 1\plain \f1\fs18 , and if you do not include a TYPE attribute, Lynx defaults to Arabic numbers.
\par For UL blocks without the PLAIN attribute, Lynx uses\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 *\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 +\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 o\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 #\plain \f1\fs18 ,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 @\plain \f1\fs18 \~and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -\plain \f1\fs18 \~as\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 bullets\plain \f1\fs18 \~to indicate, progressively, the depth within the six nesting levels.
\par Lynx treats UL, OL, DIR, and MENU blocks as having the COMPACT attribute by default, i.e., single spaces between LH and LI elements within those blocks. For DL blocks, double spacing will be used to separate the DT and DD elements unless the COMPACT attribute has been specified. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]

\par \plain \f1\fs18 The\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML 3.0\plain \f1\fs18 \~and later specifications provide for two classes of quotation in HTML documents. Block quotes, designated by the BLOCKQUOTE element (or it's abbreviated synonym BQ in HTML 3.0), have implied paragraph breaks preceding and following the start and end tags for the block. Character level quotes, designated by the Q element, in contrast are simply directives in the markup to insert an appropriate quotation mark.
\par Lynx renders block quotes with a greater than normal left and right indentation. Lynx does not support italics, and normally substitutes underlining, but does not underline block quotes so as not to obscure any explicit emphasis elements within the quotation. The BLOCKQUOTE or BQ block can include a CREDIT container element, whose content will be rendered as an implied new paragraph with a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 CREDIT:\plain \f1\fs18 \~label at the beginning of its first line.
\par Lynx respects nested Q start and end tags, and will use ASCII double-quotes (\plain \f1\i\fs18 "\plain \f1\fs18 ) versus grave accent (\plain \f1\i\fs18 `\plain \f1\fs18 ) and apostrophe (\plain \f1\i\fs18 '\plain \f1\fs18 ), respectively, for even versus odd depths in the nest.
\par Any ID attributes in BLOCKQUOTE, BQ or Q elements can be the target of a hyperlink in the form URL#id. It is treated just like the NAME in\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 nchors. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]

\par {\*\bkmkstart USEMAP}{\*\bkmkend USEMAP}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Lynx and Client-Side-Image-Maps
\par \plain \f1\fs18 HTML includes markup, designed primarily for graphic clients, that treats inlined images as maps, such that areas of the image within which a mouse cursor was positioned when the mouse was\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 clicked\plain \f1\fs18 \~can correspond to URLs which should be retrieved. The original implementations were based on the client sending an http server the x,y coordinates associated with the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 click\plain \f1\fs18 , for handling by a script invoked by the server, and have been termed\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 server-side-image-maps\plain \f1\fs18 . Lynx has no rational way of coping with such a procedure, and thus simply sends a 0,0 coordinate pair, which some server scripts treat as an instruction to return a document suitable for a text client.
\par Newer HTML markup provides bases for the client to determine the URLs associated with areas in the image map, and/or for a text client to process alternative markup and allow the user to make choices based on textual information. These have been termed\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 client-side-image-maps\plain \f1\fs18 .
\par Lynx recognizes and processes the MAP container element and its AREA elements, and will create a menu of links for the HREF of each AREA when the link created for the IMG element with a USEMAP attribute is activated. The menu uses the ALT attributes of the AREA elements as the link names, or, if the document's author has disregard for text clients and sight-challenged Webizens, and thus did not include ALT attributes, Lynx uses the resolved URLs pointed to by the HREF attributes as the link names. Lynx uses the TITLE attribute of the IMG element, or the TITLE attribute of the MAP, if either was present in the markup, as the title and main header of the menu. Otherwise, it uses the ALT attribute of the IMG element. If neither TITLE nor ALT attributes were present in the markup, Lynx creates and uses a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 [USEMAP]\plain \f1\fs18 pseudo-ALT. The MAPs need not be in the same document as the IMG elements. If not in the same document, Lynx will fetch the document which contains the referenced MAP, and locate it based on its NAME or ID attribute. All MAPs encountered in documents during a Lynx session are cached, so that they need not be retrieved repeatedly when referenced in different documents.
\par If the IMG element also indicates a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 server-side-image-map\plain \f1\fs18 \~via an ISMAP attribute, Lynx normally will create a link for that as well, using an\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 [ISMAP]\plain \f1\fs18 \~pseudo-ALT (followed by a hyphen to indicate its association with the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 client-side-image-map\plain \f1\fs18 ) rather than ignoring it, and will submit a 0,0 coordinate pair if that link is activated. Although, the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 client-side-image-map\plain \f1\fs18 \~may be more useful for a client such as Lynx, because all of the URLs associated with the image map can be accessed, and their nature indicated via ALT attributes, Lynx-friendly sites can map 0,0 such that the server returns a for-text-client document homologous to the content of FIG elements (see below). Inclusion of such a link for submissions to the server can be disabled by default via the configuration file (\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 ), and the default can be toggled via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -ismap\plain \f1\fs18 \~command line switch.
\par Lynx also recognizes the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML 3.0\plain \f1\fs18 \~FIG and OVERLAY elements, and will handle them as intended for text clients. These are the ideal way to handle\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 client-side-image-maps\plain \f1\fs18 , because the FIG content provides complete alternative markup, rather than relying on the client to construct a relatively meager list of links with link names based on ALT strings.
\par The presently experimental OBJECT element encompasses much of the functionality of the FIG element for\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 client-side-image-maps\plain \f1\fs18 . Lynx will render and display the content of OBJECT elements which have the SHAPES attribute equivalently to its handling of FIG. Lynx also handles OBJECT elements with the USEMAP and/or ISMAP attributes equivalently to its handling of IMG elements with\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 client-side-image-maps\plain \f1\fs18 \~and/or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 server-side-image-maps\plain \f1\fs18 .

\par \plain \f1\fs18 HTML includes provision for passing instructions to clients via directives in META elements, and one such instruction, via the token\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Refresh\plain \f1\fs18 , should invoke reloading of the document, fetched from a server with the same URL or a new URL, at a specified number of seconds following receipt of the current document. This procedure has been termed\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 client-side-pull\plain \f1\fs18 . An example of such an element is:\plain \f1\i\fs18       <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="3; URL=http://host/path">
\par \plain \f1\fs18 which instructs a client to fetch the indicated URL in 3 seconds after receiving the current document.

A\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 no-cache\plain \f1\fs18 \~directive is implied when the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Refresh\plain \f1\fs18 \~if for the same URL.
\par Lynx recognizes and processes\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Refresh\plain \f1\fs18 \~directives in META elements, but puts up a labeled link, typically in the upper left corner of the display, indicating the number of seconds intended before a refresh, and the URL for the refresh, instead of making the request automatically after the indicated number of seconds. This allows people using a braille interface any amount of time to examine the current document before activating the link for the next URL. In general, if the number of seconds indicated is short, the timing is not critical and you can activate the link whenever you like. If it is long (e.g., 60 seconds), a server process may be generating new documents or images at that interval, and you would be wasting bandwidth by activating the link at a shorter interval.

\par HTTP provides a means to carry state information across successive connections between a browser and an http server. Normally, http servers respond to each browser request without relating that request to previous or subsequent requests. Though the inclusion of INPUT fields with TYPE="hidden" can be used as a sort of state management by\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 HTML Forms\plain \f1\fs18 , a more general approach involves exchanges of MIME headers between the server and browser. When replying to a request, the server can send a\plain \f1\i\fs18 Set-Cookie\plain \f1\fs18 \~MIME header which contains information (\plain \f1\i\fs18 cookies\plain \f1\fs18 ) relevant to the browser's request, and in subsequent requests the browser can send a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Cookie\plain \f1\fs18 \~MIME header with information derived from previously received cookies.
\par State Management via cookie exchanges originally was implemented by Netscape, and such cookies are now designated as\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Version 0\plain \f1\fs18 . A more elaborate format for cookies, designated as\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Version 1\plain \f1\fs18 , is being standardized by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force). Lynx supports both\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Version 0\plain \f1\fs18 \~and\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Version 1\plain \f1\fs18 \~cookie exchanges. This support can be disabled by default via the SET_COOKIES symbol in the compilation (\plain \f1\i\fs18 userdefs.h\plain \f1\fs18 ) and/or run time (\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 ) configuration files, and that default setting can be toggled via the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -cookies\plain \f1\fs18 \~command line switch. The SET_COOKIES symbol can be further modified by the ACCEPT_ALL_COOKIES mode. If ACCEPT_ALL_COOKIES is set TRUE, and SET_COOKIES is TRUE, Lynx will accept all cookies. Additionally, the cookies that are automatically accepted or rejected by Lynx can be further modified with the COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS and COOKIE_REJECT_DOMAINS options in your .lynxrc file, each of which is a comma-separated list of domains to perform the desired action. The domain listed in these options must be identical to the domain the cookie comes from, there is no wildcard matching. If a domain is specific in both COOKIE_ACCEPT_DOMAINS and COOKIE_REJECT_DOMAINS, rejection will take precedence.
\par When cookie support is enabled,\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Set-Cookie\plain \f1\fs18 \~MIME headers received from an http server invoke confirmation prompts with possible replies of '\plain \f1\i\fs18 Y\plain \f1\fs18 'es or '\plain \f1\i\fs18 N\plain \f1\fs18 'o for acceptance of the cookie, '\plain \f1\i\fs18 A\plain \f1\fs18 'lways to accept the cookie and to allow all subsequent cookies from that\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 domain\plain \f1\fs18 \~(server's Fully Qualified Domain Name, or site-identifying portion of the FQDN) without further confirmation prompts, or ne'\plain \f1\i\fs18 V\plain \f1\fs18 'er to never allow cookies from that\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 domain\plain \f1\fs18 \~to be accepted (silently ignore its\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Set-Cookie\plain \f1\fs18 \~MIME headers). All unexpired cookies are held in a hypothetical\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Cookie Jar\plain \f1\fs18 \~which can be examined via the COOKIE_JAR keystroke command, normally mapped to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Ctrl-K\plain \f1\fs18 , for invoking the\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Cookie Jar Page\plain \f1\fs18 . If Lynx has been compiled with the --enable-persistent-cookies flag, then unexpired cookies will be stored between sessions in the filename set with the COOKIE_FILE option in your .lynxrc.
\par A common use of cookies by http servers is simply to track the documents visited by individual users. Though this can be useful to the site's WebMaster for evaluating and improving the organization of links in the various documents of the site, if the user has configured Lynx to include a\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 From\plain \f1\fs18 \~MIME header with the user's email address in http requests, or has passed personal information to the server via a form submission, the tracking might be used to draw inferences, possibly incorrect, about that user, and may be considered by some as an invasion of privacy.
\par An example of worthwhile State Management via cookies is the setting of personal preferences, typically via a form submission to the site, which will then apply to all documents visited at that site.
\par If you accept cookies when accessing a site, but are given no indication about how they will be used in subsequent requests to that site, nor can infer how they will be used, you can\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Gobble\plain \f1\fs18 \~(delete) the cookies and/or change the 'allow' setting for its\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 domain\plain \f1\fs18 \~via the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 Cookie Jar Page\plain \f1\fs18 .

\par {\*\bkmkstart Cache}{\*\bkmkend Cache}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Cached Documents
\par \plain \f1\fs18 A list of documents which are in lynx's internal cache is accessible through hypothetical\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Cache Jar\plain \f1\fs18 \~which can be examined via the CACHE_JAR keystroke command, normally mapped to\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Ctrl-X\plain \f1\fs18 .
\par Entries in the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Cache Jar\plain \f1\fs18 \~are ordered from oldest (at the top) to newest. The user can easily access any document which is in the cache, especially those which may be soon removed due to configurable limits on the maximum number of cached documents, as well as the maxmimum amount of memory used by the cache.
\par The structure of\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Cache Jar\plain \f1\fs18 \~is simple:

On activating this link, the user is prompted if they want to delete the document from\plain \f1\i\fs18 Cache Jar\plain \f1\fs18 . The document's address (also a link) follows the title. It is distinguished by a\~URL:\~label preceding the link. Activating this link, lynx displays the corresponding cached document.

\par {\*\bkmkstart Sessions}{\*\bkmkend Sessions}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Sessions
\par \plain \f1\fs18 Lynx's current state (all information about the user's current activity with lynx) is called a session. Sessions are useful in particular if you are in the middle of exploring something on the web and you were forced to stop abruptly, losing any trace of your current work.
\par A session can be automatically restored as lynx starts after a clean exit. The session data is saved if lynx is invoked with the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -session=FILENAME\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch. The\plain \f1\i\fs18 FILENAME\plain \f1\fs18 \~is the name of the file where the session will be stored.
\par There are also switches for only restoring:\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -sessionin=FILENAME\plain \f1\fs18 \~and for only saving:\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -sessionout=FILENAME\plain \f1\fs18 \~sesions:
\par If you do not want to specify these options at each lynx startup, there is an option in\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~to enable automatic saving/restoring of session. To keep lynx startup/exit reasonable fast there is also an option in\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 \~specifying how much information about the current lynx session will be stored in file.
\par The syntax of the session file is simple. You can use a text editor to modify, add new entries, or remove URLs you no longer want. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart Invoking}{\*\bkmkend Invoking}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 The Lynx command line
\par \plain \f1\fs18 A summary of the Lynx command line options (switches) is returned to stdout if Lynx is invoked with the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -help\plain \f1\fs18 \~switch. A description of the options also should be available via the system man (Unix) pages or help (VMS) libraries. On Win32, typing lynx -help in a DOS window should display similarly. The basic syntax of the Lynx command line can be represented as one of the following:Commandlynx [options]lynx [options] startfilewherestartfileis the file or URL that Lynx will load at start-up.
\par \pard\li720\fi-360\jclisttab\tx720\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 {\listtext\pard\plain\f3\fs24\lang1024 \uc2\u183 \'a1\'a4\uc1\tab}\ls8\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 If startfile is not specified, Lynx will use a default starting file and base directory determined during installation.
\par \plain{\listtext\pard\plain\f3\fs24\lang1024 \uc2\u183 \'a1\'a4\uc1\tab}\ls8\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 If a specified file is local (i.e., not a URL) Lynx displays that file and uses the directory in which that file resides as the base directory.
\par \plain{\listtext\pard\plain\f3\fs24\lang1024 \uc2\u183 \'a1\'a4\uc1\tab}\ls8\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 If a URL is specified, the file will be retrieved, and only the server base directory will be relevant to further accesses.
\par \plain{\listtext\pard\plain\f3\fs24\lang1024 \uc2\u183 \'a1\'a4\uc1\tab}\ls8\ilvl0 \plain \f1\fs18 If more than one local file or remote URL is listed on the command line, Lynx will open only the last interactively. All of the names (local files and remote URLs) are added to the G)oto history.
\par \plain\pard\fi0\li0\ql\ri0\sb0\sa0\itap0 \plain \f1\fs18 optionsLynx uses only long option names. Option names can begin with double dash as well, underscores and dashes can be intermixed in option names (in the reference below options are with one dash before them and with underscores).
\par Lynx provides many command-line options. Some options require a value (string, number or keyword). These are noted in the reference below. The other options set boolean values in the program. There are three types of boolean options: set, unset and toggle. If no option value is given, these have the obvious meaning: set (to true), unset (to false), or toggle (between true/false). For any of these, an explicit value can be given in different forms to allow for operating system constraints, e.g.,
\par 
\par -center:off\'0a 
\par               -center=off\'0a 
\par               -center-Lynx recognizes "1", "+", "on" and "true" for true values, and "0", "-", "off" and "false" for false values. Other option-values are ignored.
\par The default boolean, number and string option values that are compiled into lynx are displayed in the help-message provided by lynx -help. Some of those may differ according to how lynx was built; see the help message itself for these values. The -help option is processed before any option, including those that control reading from the lynx.cfg file. Therefore runtime configuration values are not reflected in the help-message.
\par Capitalized items in the option summary indicate that a substitution must be made. These are the options:
\par -If the argument is only '-' (dash), then Lynx expects to receive the arguments from stdin. This is to allow for the potentially very long command line that can be associated with the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -get_data\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -post_data\plain \f1\fs18 \~arguments (see below). It can also be used to avoid having sensitive information in the invoking command line (which would be visible to other processes on most systems), especially when the\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -auth\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 -pauth\plain \f1\fs18 \~options are used. On VMS, the dash must be encased in double-quotes ("-") and the keyboard input terminated with\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 Control-Z\plain \f1\fs18 \~or the command file input terminated by a line that begins with '\plain \f1\i\fs18 $\plain \f1\fs18 '.

Default color control sequences which work for many terminal types are assumed if the terminal capability description does not specify how to handle color. Lynx needs to be compiled with the slang library for this flag. It is equivalent to setting the COLORTERM environment variable. (If color support is instead provided by a color-capable curses library like ncurses, Lynx relies completely on the terminal description to determine whether color mode is possible, and this flag is not needed and thus unavailable.)

\par \plain \f1\fs18 Lynx uses certain environment variables and sets a few of them. Please visit a\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 separate page\plain \f1\fs18 \~for this rather technical information. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart lynx_cfg}{\*\bkmkend lynx_cfg}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Main configuration file lynx.cfg
\par \plain \f1\fs18 Lynx has several levels of customization: from the Options Menu (accessible on-line, and possibly stored in your local .lynxrc file), via command-line switches on startup (mainly for batch processing). The most important and numerous default settings are stored in the Lynx configuration file\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 .
\par If you are on a UNIX system you should have appropriate permissions to make changes there or ask your system administrator to modify lynx.cfg for your needs. This file provides default settings for all accounts on your system. It may be copied to your shell account and included with -cfg command line switch or via an environment variable LYNX_CFG (if you have shell access). Starting with version 2.8.1 Lynx has an include facility so you can load the system-wide configuration file and easily add one or more settings from your local add-on configuration file. It is really cool to read lynx.cfg with its comments for hundreds of options, most of them commented out because they are built-in defaults. You may visit an index of options:\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 by category\plain \f1\fs18 \~or\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 by alphabet\plain \f1\fs18 .
\par To view your current configuration derived from lynx.cfg and any included configuration files, press\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 'g'\plain \f1\fs18 \~and type in '\plain \f1\i\fs18 lynxcfg:\plain \f1\fs18 '. If you are using the forms-based\plain \f1\i\fs18 Options Menu\plain \f1\fs18 , you may press\~\plain \f1\i\fs18 'o'\plain \f1\fs18 \~for the Options Menu and follow the '\plain \f1\i\fs18 Check your lynx.cfg\plain \f1\fs18 ' link near the bottom.
\par However, for those who have a restricted account many Lynx features may be disabled by the system administrator, you probably will not see your lynx.cfg. [\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 ToC\plain \f1\fs18 ]
\par {\*\bkmkstart Hist}{\*\bkmkend Hist}\plain \f1\b\i\fs18 Lynx development history
\par \plain \f1\fs18 Lynx grew out of efforts to build a campus-wide information system at The University of Kansas. The earliest versions of Lynx provided a user-friendly, distributed hypertext interface for users connected to multiuser (Unix and VMS) systems via curses-oriented display devices. A custom hypertext format was developed to support hypertext links to local files and files on remote Gopher servers. Using Gopher servers for distributed file service allowed information providers to publish information from a wide variety of platforms (including Unix, VMS, VM/CMS and Macintosh). In addition, Lynx became the most user-friendly Gopher client, although that was only an ancillary capability.
\par This distributed approach let providers retain complete control over their information, but it made communication between users and providers somewhat more difficult. Following the lead of Neal Erdwien, of Kansas State University, the Lynx hypertext format was extended to include links for including ownership information with each file. This information made it possible for users running Lynx clients to send comments and suggestions via e-mail to the providers.
\par This early version of Lynx was also augmented to support hypertext links to programs running on remote systems. It included the ability to open a Telnet connection, as well as the ability to start programs via rexec, inetd, or by direct socket connects. These capabilities were included to allow users to access databases or custom program interfaces.
\par A subsequent version of Lynx incorporated the World Wide Web libraries to allow access to the full list of WWW servers, along with the option to build hypertext documents in HTML, rather than the native Lynx format. HTML has become far more widely used, and the native format has been phased out. With the addition of the WWW libraries, Lynx became a fully-featured WWW client, limited only by the display capabilities offered in the curses environment.
\par Lynx was designed by Lou Montulli, Charles Rezac and Michael Grobe of Academic Computing Services at The University of Kansas. Lynx was implemented by Lou Montulli and maintained by Garrett Arch Blythe and Craig Lavender.
\par \plain \f1\i\fs18 Foteos Macrides\plain \f1\fs18 \~and members of the\~\plain \f1\ul\fs18\cf1 lynx-dev\plain \f1\fs18 \~list have developed and supported Lynx since release of v2.3 in May 1994.
\par The Lynx2-3FM code set was released as v2.4 in June 1995.
\par The Lynx2-4FM code set was released as v2.5 in May 1996.
\par The Lynx2-5FM code set was released as v2.6 in September 1996.
\par The Lynx2-6FM code set was released as v2.7 in February 1997.
\par The v2-7FM code set was released as v2.7.1 in April 1997.
\par The v2-7-1FM code set was released as v2.7.2 in January 1998.
\par The 2.7.1 development set was released as v2.8 in March 1998.
\par The 2.8 development set was released as v2.8.1 in October 1998.
\par The 2.8.1 development set was released as v2.8.2 in June 1999.
\par The 2.8.2 development set was released as v2.8.3 in April 2000.
\par The 2.8.3 development set was released as v2.8.4 in July 2001.
\par The 2.8.4 development set was released as v2.8.5 in February 2004.
\par The 2.8.5 development set was released as v2.8.6 in October 2006.
\par The 2.8.6 development set was released as v2.8.7 in July 2009.
\par Since early 1997, the Lynx code has expanded into autoconfigure and PC versions. The branching of the Lynx source base from a single source into two sources (FM/Foteos Macrides and ac/autoconfigure) should be considered a healthy synergism among groups of computer professionals acting in their spare time out of a common goal.
\par Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along the way. The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of Computing Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ in the Unix environment. Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients developed at the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee (and others) and the WWW community.
